# Filepress

**Write content as flat files. Use it anywhere in your Rails app.**

Filepress lets you manage content in plain text files with frontmatter — like Markdown, HTML, or anything else — and sync them directly into your ActiveRecord models. It's the simplicity of static files, with the full power of a Rails backend.
